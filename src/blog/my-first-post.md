# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post! I'm excited to share my thoughts on web development, technology, and my journey as a software engineer.

## What You Can Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Web Development**: Tips, tricks, and best practices
- **Project Showcases**: Deep dives into my latest projects
- **Tech Industry**: Insights and experiences
- **Learning Journey**: Sharing what I learn along the way

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component to get started:

```javascript
const BlogPost = ({ title, content }) => {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <div>{content}</div>
    </article>
  );
};

export default BlogPost;
```

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for more content! I'll be sharing insights from my work on various projects, including:

- My Anime Discovery Engine
- ResumeTex API development
- Machine Learning experiments
- Hackathon experiences

Thanks for reading, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions for future posts!
